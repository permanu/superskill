## The Problem

[skills.sh](https://skills.sh) solved skill discovery and installation — 90,000+ skills, 40+ agents, one standard. But installation is static. You browse, pick, install, and hope you chose right.

When you have 15 skills installed and say "write tests for my Go API" — which one loads? What about the three competing TDD skills? What if the model's context window can't fit them all?

**skills.sh is where you find skills. SuperSkill is what loads the right one at the right time.**

## How It Works

1. **Install skills however you want** — `npx skills add`, manual download, or use the 87 built-in skills
2. **Describe your task** — "write tests for my Go API"
3. **SuperSkill scores, resolves, and loads** — trigger-based matching picks the best skill, resolves collisions, respects your context budget

SuperSkill scans your installed skills (from `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, etc.), merges them with its built-in catalog, and routes tasks to the best match at runtime.

## What SuperSkill Adds

| Layer | What it does | Why you need it |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Router** | Task description → best matching skill | No manual browsing or memorizing skill names |
| **Arbiter** | 3 TDD skills installed? Profile picks the winner | Prevents collision chaos and token waste |
| **Scanner** | Discovers installed skills from any source | Works with skills.sh, manual installs, or built-in |
| **Memory** | Remembers activations within a session | No redundant fetches for similar tasks |
| **Vault** | ADRs, learnings, sessions, project context | Persistent knowledge that survives across sessions |

## Quick Start

### Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add permanu/superskill
/plugin install superskill
```

### Any MCP-compatible tool

```bash
npm install -g superskill
```

Then add as an MCP server:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add superskill -e VAULT_PATH=~/Vaults/ai -- npx -y superskill

# Cursor, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini CLI — add to MCP config:
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superskill": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "superskill"],
      "env": { "VAULT_PATH": "~/Vaults/ai" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Works with skills.sh

Install skills from the ecosystem, SuperSkill routes to them automatically:

```bash
npx skills add anthropics/skills          # Anthropic's official skills
npx skills add affaan-m/everything-claude-code  # ECC skill suite
# SuperSkill discovers and scores these on next activation
```
