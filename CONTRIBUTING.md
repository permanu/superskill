# Contributing to SuperSkill

SuperSkill is the skill package manager for AI coding agents. Contributions are welcome — whether you're adding skills to the registry, improving the runtime, or fixing bugs.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/permanu/superskill.git
cd superskill
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Adding a Skill

SuperSkill uses the [Agent Skills](https://skills.sh) standard. Every skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

### Skill Authoring Quick Start

1. Copy the template: `cp docs/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md my-skill/SKILL.md`
2. Fill in frontmatter and content
3. Validate: `superskill-cli skill validate my-skill/SKILL.md`
4. Submit a PR using the [skill submission template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/skill_submission.md)

### Skill Structure

A skill is a single `SKILL.md` file. The YAML frontmatter defines metadata for discovery and validation. The Markdown body contains the actual methodology or instructions that get injected into the AI context.

### Frontmatter Reference

| Field       | Required | Description                              |
|-------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| name        | Yes      | Human-readable skill name                |
| description | Yes      | One-line description (used for matching) |
| version     | Yes      | SemVer (e.g., 1.0.0)                    |
| tags        | No       | Array of keywords for discovery          |

### Writing Good Content

- Lead with the methodology, not setup instructions
- Include concrete examples
- Keep under 3000 tokens (check with `superskill-cli skill validate`)
- Use sections: Overview, When to Use, Steps, Examples

### Trigger Keywords

Triggers are how SuperSkill matches tasks to skills. Include 3-7 keywords per skill:

- Action verbs users would say
- Tool/framework names
- Synonyms (e.g., "ship" and "deploy")

### Validation

Run before submitting:

```bash
superskill-cli skill validate path/to/SKILL.md
```

Checks:

- Required frontmatter fields present
- Description not empty
- Version is valid semver
- Content not empty

### Publishing via skills.sh

The recommended way to share skills:

1. Create a GitHub repo with your `SKILL.md` files
2. Users install with: `superskill-cli skill add your-username/your-repo`

### Adding to the Built-in Registry

For high-quality, widely-useful skills:

1. Fork this repo
2. Add skill metadata to `registry/index.json`
3. Open a PR using the skill submission template

## Development Workflow

### Branching

- `main` is the release branch — always shippable
- Feature branches: `feat/<name>` (e.g. `feat/session-memory`)
- Bug fixes: `fix/<name>` (e.g. `fix/false-positive-go-pattern`)
- Docs: `docs/<name>`

### Pull Requests

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with tests
3. Ensure `npm run build && npm test` passes locally
4. Open a PR against `main`
5. PRs require CI to pass (lint + build + test:coverage)
6. Squash merge — one clean commit per PR

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add session-aware skill memory
fix: tighten regex for Go domain matching
docs: add contributing guide
ci: add automated release workflow
chore: bump version to 0.3.0
```

Include `Fixes #N` or `Closes #N` to auto-close issues.

## Release Process

### Release Discipline

Releases are **batched, not per-PR**. Multiple PRs accumulate on `main` before a release is cut.

**When to release:**
- A milestone is complete (e.g. all v0.3.0 issues closed)
- A logical batch of features/fixes is ready
- A critical security fix needs immediate deployment

**When NOT to release:**
- After every individual PR
- To test if something works (use `--plugin-dir` for local testing)
- Without updating the changelog

### Release Checklist

1. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** — Move items from `[Unreleased]` to a new version section
2. **Bump version** in `package.json` — follow [semver](https://semver.org/):
   - Patch (0.2.x): bug fixes, minor improvements
   - Minor (0.x.0): new features, backward-compatible
   - Major (x.0.0): breaking changes
3. **Commit**: `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`
4. **Push to main**: `git push origin main`
5. **Tag and push**: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
6. **Automated**: CI runs lint + test + coverage → npm publish → GitHub release

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) handles npm publish and GitHub release creation automatically. Release notes are extracted from `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changelog Format

Keep an `[Unreleased]` section at the top. Move entries to a versioned section when cutting a release:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New feature description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- ...
```

## Writing Tests

- All new features require tests
- All bug fixes require a regression test
- Run: `npm test` (all tests) or `npm test -- src/path/to/file.test.ts` (single file)
- Coverage thresholds: 80% lines, 85% functions, 80% branches, 80% statements

### Test Patterns

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";

describe("myFeature", () => {
  it("does the expected thing", () => {
    // Arrange → Act → Assert
  });

  it("handles edge case", () => {
    // ...
  });

  // False positive guards for regex patterns
  it("does NOT match unrelated input", () => {
    expect(matchSomething("irrelevant")).not.toContain("wrong-domain");
  });
});
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode
- No AI attribution in commits or code
- SPDX license headers on all source files: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later OR Commercial`
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Keep functions focused — if it's doing two things, split it

## Security

Community skills fetched via web discovery are scanned for:
- Prompt injection / override attempts
- Data exfiltration patterns
- Destructive filesystem commands
- Script injection
- Memory wipe instructions

Role-play instructions ("you are now acting as X") are allowed with a warning — this is normal for skills that adopt a persona.

If you're modifying `web-discovery.ts`, ensure security scan tests pass and cover your changes.
